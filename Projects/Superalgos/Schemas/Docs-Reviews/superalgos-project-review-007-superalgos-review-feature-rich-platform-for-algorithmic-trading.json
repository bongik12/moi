I started looking for a trading bot that I could leverage to make trades, but quickly realized that most of the software available today required me to give my account information to a service hosted by someone else.",

A familiarity with coding, particularly in Javascript, is helpful, but not necessary to execute successful strategies. The tool features an entirely visual scripting designer to help create and debug your very own strategies and indicators. Once your strategy is designed, the tool has built-in backtesting capabilities that leverage downloaded historical market data, giving you peace of mind that your strategy is fully tested before moving on to live trading.
