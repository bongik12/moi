Sure, Superalgos looks intimidating at first, and it will certainly take me a lot of effort to get my head around it, but then again, everything is laid out there to study - while all the over-complicated stuff has been mercifully hidden from me. And with its beautiful design, it sort of feels like you're playing a game ;)",
