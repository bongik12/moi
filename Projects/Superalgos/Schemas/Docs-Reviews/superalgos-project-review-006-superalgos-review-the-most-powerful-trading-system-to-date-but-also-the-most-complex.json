        "text": "Superalgos is by far the most powerful, intuitive, and flexible trading system available today. It's so much more than a traditional trading bot. The power and extensibility of this open-source marvel is mind-blowing. However, it's often said that nothing in life worth having is easy, and that's certainly true of Superalgos. You'll have to invest a lot of time and patience to learn a system that has more features than the newest Tesla. Is it worth it? Absolutely!",

It was the best find of my life. Although this system is very early in its development, it is already developed enough to allow complicated trading strategies to be implemented, and it has undergone massive improvement in just the short time I've been using it.",

First, do the 'Welcome to Superalgos!' tutorial, and do it multiple times to catch the nuances you missed in previous reviews of the tutorial. Then do the 'Install a New Market' tutorial and the trading system design tutorials (in a separate plug-in) multiple times. Finally go through the Users Manual in the documentation to learn about all the important features in this comprehensive software package.",
