If you freeze the head node of a hierarchy, then the whole hierarchy is frozen. Freezing node structures is effective only when nodes are loose, that is, when they are not affected by angle or distance settings and are unpinned. In such cases, freezing releases CPU resources, as the system stops calculating node’s positions and status.",
