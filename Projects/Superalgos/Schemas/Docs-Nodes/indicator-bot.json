As such, you do not need to code any of the functions that make up the infrastructure functionality. Dependencies, outputs, data structures, execution sequences, and several other problems are handled by the definitions embodied in the structure of nodes that make up an indicator, and are configured in the visual environment of the design space. Coding is limited to the actual calculation and data building procedures."
