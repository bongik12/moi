The value 0 indicates that there are 0% chances of the order getting filled. With such a setting, the order will never get filled in the simulation.  The value 1 indicates that there is a 100% probability of the order getting filled. With such a setting, the order is filled upon the first tag of the price. A value of 0.5 indicates a 50% probability, thus, it takes two tags of the price for the order to fill completely with such a setting."
