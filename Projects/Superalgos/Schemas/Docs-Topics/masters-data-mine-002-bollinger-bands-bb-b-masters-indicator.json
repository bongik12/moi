We are plotting the moving average with one color when it is going up, and with a different color when it’s going down. The upper band is at 2 Standard Deviations from the moving average, pretty much like the lower band, also at 2 Standard Deviations. These are the most widely used Bollinger Bands settings."

In a nutshell, it tells you how close the price is either to the upper band or the lower band at any point in time. When the price is in the middle of the bands (it is calculated with the close value of each candle), then %B is in the middle of its chart, at value 50. When the price touches the upper band, then %B is at 100, and finally when the price is at the lower band, then %B is at 0."

In our chart, %B is the one represented at #1. We’ve found useful to add a moving average to smooth volatility a bit and to be able to ask—at any time—if it is going up or down. The moving average calculated with the last 5 %B values is plotted as line #2. Finally, we’ve also added a property called Bandwidth, which represents the separation of the upper band from the lower band. It is a measure of volatility and is plotted at #3."
