One day of Raw Data takes about 5 minutes to download. Keep this in mind when setting a start date. The reason for this is because they do not support fetching of OHCLV data - this data has to be compiled by fetching individual trades. The fetching of trades is limited to 100 trades per request, and the rate limit is 1 second.",
