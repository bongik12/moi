What Superalgos refers to as the current candle is effectively the latest closed candle. The trading bot never works with the candle that hasnâ€™t yet closed, as its parameters are not defined. For example, candle.max refers to the maximum price of the last closed candle, and bollingerBand.movingAverage refers to the moving average of the last closed candle.",

Upon each execution, anything between 0 to 60 seconds may have passed since the last one-minute candle closed. On top of this the sensor execution time may range from 1 to 5 seconds, depending on several factors (i.e.: your hardware, internet bandwidth, distance to the exchange, exchange response time, and so on...) |\n| Candles - Volumes indicator | 1 - 5 | This indicator is required most of the time, as it is the one processing the one-minute candles extracted from the exchange to turn it into candles for the rest of the time frames available. In this case, the processing time depends entirely on your hardware. | \n| Other indicators | 1 - 5 | Indicators that depend exclusively on the data products produced by Candles - Volumes may process their products as soon as Candles - Volumes finishes. Indicators with nested dependencies need to wait for their dependencies to finish, thus they are not processed in parallel but in series. |\n| Trading bot | 1 - 5 | Depending on the complexity of your trading system, the number of dependencies that must be loaded, your hardware, and the same connectivity considerations discussed for the sensor bot, the trading bot may take several seconds to do the processing and place the order at the exchange. |",
