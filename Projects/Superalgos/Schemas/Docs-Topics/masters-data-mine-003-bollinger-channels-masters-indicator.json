Essentially an upward channel begins when the moving average changes direction from going down to going up, and the channel finishes when it turns from going up to down. A downward channel starts when the Bollinger Band moving average turns from going up to down, and it finishes when it starts going up again. Upward channels are plotted in green, while downward channels in red. Additional information can be found at the indicatorâ€™s panel, like the number of periods contained at the channel."

The most important property of a sub-channel is its slope. The possible values are Side, Gentle, Medium, High and Extreme. With this information, a trading bot could easily ask if it is in a sub-channel with a certain slope and for how many periods. The slope or inclination of the moving average may be an indication of momentum."
