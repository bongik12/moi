There are just a few differences I will walk you through. One major difference is that each Time Machine can only reference one Trading Session. For example, one Backtesting Session that is associated with one Trading System. This helps keep your charts clean and readable. It would be confusing to see buy orders from two different trading systems all at once! What this means for connecting a chart is that we need to establish two references in order for things to work.",
